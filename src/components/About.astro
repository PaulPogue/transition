          Throughout my career, I have worked in and around small businesses,
          taking on various roles and wearing many hats. This background allows
          me to understand the unique challenges small business owners face and
          makes me uniquely suited to help those who need a year-round
          accounting partner—not just someone who appears at tax time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg font-light leading-relaxed pb-5">
          Running a business is demanding and constantly evolving, and my goal
          is to work closely with small businesses to simplify bookkeeping and
          implement accounting best practices. By maintaining clean, up-to-date
          records throughout the year, tax preparation becomes streamlined as
          the books are accurate and current.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg font-light leading-relaxed pb-10">
          If you’re looking for an accountant who helps you plan ahead, improve
          efficiency, and keep more of what you earn, let’s work together to
          build a smarter, more profitable business.
